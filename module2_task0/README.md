<h1 align="center"> Module 2: Testing in the Software Development Methodology

# Learning Objectives
This project aims at practicing with automated tests. The goal is to understand the pros and cons of different testing methods to be able to understand the value of doing, or not doing, a kind of test.

After this project, you should be able to:

Understand what linting is the extent of its usages (which kind of file can be linted, and the impact of running it often)
Understand the difference between unit tests and integration tests
Use code coverage as a helper to write tests
Understand that not only “classical” code is to be tested, but also a lot of the artifacts we can generate
Understand how “component”-based testing for acceptance and end to end validation is to be used
